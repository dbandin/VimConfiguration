# Diego's VIM configuration

This repository is my personal .vim directory with the current plugins and color schemes that I am using. The current modules belong to 3rd party coders, I left the bundles linked to the original owners.

In the main directory of the repository the "vimrc" could be found, this file should be moved to ~/.vimrc to load all the mappings, colorschemes and plugin loads.

I based big part of my configuration in sontek's config -> http://www.sontek.net/blog/2011/05/07/turning_vim_into_a_modern_python_ide.html
